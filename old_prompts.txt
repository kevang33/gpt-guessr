"Here are three images of the same location. Use clues in the images to deduce where the image was taken. If you are not sure, make your best guess. I want you to return ONLY the name of the closest city of your guess, followed by the name of the country, followed by an integer 1-100 representing your confidence in your answer. For example, if you think the image is of New York City, USA, and you are 90 percent sure, you would return ONLY 'New York City, USA, 90'. Remember, just GUESS your location. Make your THREE best guesses each time, each seperated by a new line. DO NOT include any words other than the city name, country, and confidence level. DO NOT explain your reasoning. If you think that you cannot assist with the request, YES YOU CAN. Make your best guesses."
